Introduction
This program is designed to help you convert text into Morse code and vice versa. It uses a predefined Morse code tree represented by an array. You can encode English text into Morse code by entering the desired text, and the program will output the corresponding Morse code. Similarly, you can decode Morse code by entering the Morse code sequence, and the program will convert it back to English text.

In addition to encoding and decoding, the program offers several other operations. You can search for a specific element in the Morse code tree and replace it with a different element. It is also possible to insert new elements into the tree at a specified index. Furthermore, you can search for an element in the tree and delete it. The program provides a display function to show the Morse code tree.

Options
Decode Morse code to English text
Choose this option to decode Morse code into English text. Enter the Morse code sequence, using one space between the Morse code of each character. Separate words with a slash (/). The program will convert the Morse code sequence into English text and display the result.

Encode English text to Morse code
Select this option to encode English text into Morse code. Enter the text you want to convert to Morse code, and the program will output the corresponding Morse code sequence.

Search and replace an element in the Morse code tree
This option allows you to search for a specific element in the Morse code tree and replace it with a different element. Enter the element you wish to replace, and then enter the replacement element. The program will search for the element in the tree and perform the replacement if found.

Insert an element into the Morse code tree
Choose this option to insert a new element into the Morse code tree. Enter the element you wish to insert, followed by the index at which you want to insert it. The program will insert the element at the specified index if it is available.

Search and delete an element in the Morse code tree
This option enables you to search for a specific element in the Morse code tree and delete it. Enter the element you wish to delete, and the program will search for it in the tree and delete it if found.

Display the Morse code tree
Selecting this option will display the Morse code tree. The program will show each element in the tree along with its corresponding Morse code representation.

Exit the program
Choosing this option will exit the program.

Examples
Here are a few examples to help you understand how to use the program:

Encode English text to Morse code:

vbnet
Copy code
Enter what you wish to convert to Morse: Hello World
Encoded Text is: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
Decode Morse code to English text:

vbnet
Copy code
Enter the Morse code which you wish to decode:
Kindly put one space between the Morse code of each character.
Use slash (/) to separate words.
Your Input: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
The decoded Text is: HELLO WORLD
Search and replace an element in the Morse code tree:

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the element you wish to replace: h
Item Found in tree
Enter the element you wish to replace it with: j
Item Replaced Successfully
The morse code of the replaced item is: . .-.. .-..
Insert an element into the Morse code tree:

lua
Copy code
Enter the element you wish to insert in the tree: z
Enter the index at which you wish to insert: 25
Item Inserted Successfully
The morse code of the inserted item is: --..
Search and delete an element in the Morse code tree:

css
Copy code
Enter the element you wish to delete from the tree: y
Item deleted Successfully
Display the Morse code tree:

less
Copy code
. : E
- : T
.. : I
... : S
