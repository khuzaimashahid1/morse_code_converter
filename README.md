## Introduction

This program is designed to help you convert text into Morse code and vice versa. It uses a predefined Morse code tree represented by an array. You can encode English text into Morse code by entering the desired text, and the program will output the corresponding Morse code. Similarly, you can decode Morse code by entering the Morse code sequence, and the program will convert it back to English text.

In addition to encoding and decoding, the program offers several other operations. You can search for a specific element in the Morse code tree and replace it with a different element. It is also possible to insert new elements into the tree at a specified index. Furthermore, you can search for an element in the tree and delete it. The program provides a display function to show the Morse code tree.
